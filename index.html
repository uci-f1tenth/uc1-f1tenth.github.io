        <p>F1Tenth racing is within reach.</p>
        <p>Building small-scale autonomous racing cars is the most exciting technical challenge of our time.</p>
        <p>We have started UCI's first F1Tenth lab, with one goal and one product: a competitive autonomous racing car.</p>
        <p>It's called F1Tenth @ UCI.</p>
        <p>F1Tenth is our mission, our name, and our entire project roadmap, because it is our sole focus. Our team, resources, and approach are all aligned to achieve F1Tenth racing excellence.</p>
        <p>We approach speed and safety in tandem, as technical problems to be solved through innovative engineering and scientific breakthroughs. We plan to advance capabilities as fast as possible while ensuring our cars always remain safe.</p>
        <p>This way, we can race in peace.</p>
        <p>Our singular focus means no distraction by other projects or coursework, and our approach means safety, performance, and progress are all insulated from short-term pressures.</p>
        <p>We are a UCI student organization with meetings on campus, where we have access to resources and the ability to recruit top engineering talent.</p>
        <p>We are assembling a lean, skilled team of UCI's best engineers and researchers dedicated to focusing on F1Tenth and nothing else.</p>
        <p>If that's you, we offer an opportunity to do exciting work and help solve the most important challenges in autonomous racing. <a href="https://discord.gg/KWENJaPCMK">Join us on Discord</a>.</p>
